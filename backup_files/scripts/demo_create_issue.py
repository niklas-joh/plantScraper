1. Functionality Changes:
   - Capture recipe URLs during scraping
   - Store recipe links alongside recipe names in JSON output
   - Maintain existing recipe name formatting

2. Technical Implementation:
   - Update process_field_with_subheadings() to extract recipe links
   - Modify JSON structure to store recipe links
   - Update documentation to reflect new data structure

3. Expected Output Format:
```json
"Recipes": {
    "Pasta Salad With Spinach and Artichokes": "https://www.almanac.com/recipe/...",
    "Shrimp and Artichoke Casserole": "https://www.almanac.com/recipe/..."
}
```

4. Acceptance Criteria:
   - All recipe links are correctly captured
   - JSON structure maintains backward compatibility
   - Links are valid and accessible
   - Documentation is updated""",
