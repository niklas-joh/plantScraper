## Project Reorganization Analysis

After analyzing the current project structure, I've identified the following key components that need to be reorganized:

### Current Structure Issues
- Multiple scraper versions with overlapping functionality
- No clear separation of concerns
- No modular architecture
- Duplicated code across files
- No consistent error handling

### Implementation Plan

1. **Directory Structure**
   - Create main directories: src/, docs/, tests/, data/, scripts/
   - Create subdirectories within src/: scraper/, processors/, utils/, github/
   - Create appropriate __init__.py files for proper Python package structure

2. **Code Refactoring**
   - Move plantscraper.py functionality to src/scraper/plant_list.py
   - Split plants_detailed_scraper_refactored.py into multiple modules:
     - src/scraper/base.py for common scraper functionality
     - src/scraper/plant_details.py for detailed plant scraping
     - src/processors/content_cleaner.py for content cleaning utilities
     - src/utils/http.py for HTTP request utilities
     - src/utils/file_io.py for file operations

3. **Configuration Management**
   - Create a config.py file for centralized configuration
   - Move hardcoded values to configuration files

4. **Testing Framework**
   - Create test files for each module
   - Implement unit tests for key functions

5. **Documentation Updates**
   - Create comprehensive README.md
   - Add docstrings to all functions and classes

6. **GitHub Integration**
   - Move GitHub-related code to src/github/ directory
   - Refactor issue management code

I'll be implementing these changes step by step to ensure a smooth transition to the new structure.
