## Project Reorganization Implementation Complete

I've completed the implementation of the project reorganization plan as described in issue #3. Here's a summary of the changes made:

### 1. Directory Structure
- Created main directories: `src/`, `docs/`, `tests/`, `data/`, `scripts/`
- Created subdirectories within src/: `scraper/`, `processors/`, `utils/`, `github/`
- Created appropriate `__init__.py` files for proper Python package structure

### 2. Code Refactoring
- Moved `plantscraper.py` functionality to `src/scraper/plant_list.py`
- Split `plants_detailed_scraper_refactored.py` into multiple modules:
  - `src/scraper/base.py` for common scraper functionality
  - `src/scraper/plant_details.py` for detailed plant scraping
  - `src/processors/content_cleaner.py` for content cleaning utilities
  - `src/utils/http.py` for HTTP request utilities
  - `src/utils/file_io.py` for file operations

### 3. Configuration Management
- Created `src/config.py` for centralized configuration
- Moved hardcoded values to configuration files

### 4. Testing Framework
- Created test files for key modules:
  - `tests/test_config.py`
  - `tests/test_http.py`
  - `tests/test_file_io.py`
- Implemented unit tests with pytest

### 5. Documentation Updates
- Created comprehensive `README.md`
- Added docstrings to all functions and classes

### 6. GitHub Integration
- Moved GitHub-related code to `src/github/` directory
- Refactored issue management code into:
  - `src/github/token_manager.py`
  - `src/github/issue_manager.py`
  - `src/github/create_issues.py`
  - `src/github/update_issue_secure.py`

### 7. Script Updates
- Updated scripts to use the new module structure:
  - `scripts/run_scraper.py`
  - `scripts/update_github_issue.py`
  - `scripts/comment_on_issue.py`

### Benefits of the New Structure

1. **Improved Maintainability**: Code is now organized by functionality, making it easier to find and modify specific components.
2. **Better Separation of Concerns**: Each module has a clear responsibility, reducing coupling between components.
3. **Enhanced Testability**: The modular structure makes it easier to write unit tests for individual components.
4. **Centralized Configuration**: All configuration settings are now in one place, making it easier to modify settings.
5. **Proper Package Structure**: The project now follows Python package best practices.
6. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Added detailed documentation for all modules and functions.

The project is now ready for further development and feature additions.
