  About Artichokes
 </h2>
 <p>
  The buds (i.e., the “artichokes” that we harvest and eat), if allowed to flower, are thistle-like and violet. These large plants can be grown in rows in the garden, as informal hedges, or planted as a wide border. Artichokes can reach heights of 3 to 5 feet.
 </p>
 <p>
  Artichokes prefer cool, humid summers and mild winters. In cool regions, plan to treat the artichoke as an annual.
 </p>
 <p>
  One plant will produce many artichokes. The biggest bud grows on the top of the plant, and many smaller ones grow beneath.
