    "Subhead": "Planting, Growing, and Harvesting Artichokes\nApril 17, 2025\nThe globe artichoke is a perennial in the thistle family that produces long, silver-green, lobed leaves that make the artichoke look like a giant fern. Learn how to plant and grow edible artichokes in your garden! About Artichokes The buds (i.e., the “artichokes” that we harvest and eat), if allowed to flower, are thistle-like and violet. These large plants can be grown in rows in the garden, as informal hedges, or planted as a wide border. Artichokes can reach heights of 3 to 5 feet. Artichokes prefer cool, humid summers and mild winters. In cool regions, plan to treat the artichoke as an annual. One plant will produce many artichokes. The biggest bud grows on the top of the plant, and many smaller ones grow beneath. Even if you don’t like to eat artichokes, they’re still worth growing for their lovely, pollinator-friendly flowers!",
    "Planting": {
      "content": "Choose a spot in the garden that gets full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight per day). Artichokes are heavy feeders. Before planting each plant, mix a shovel of compost or aged manure into the soil. They require consistent moisture but do not like waterlogged soil.",
      "sub_headings": {
        "When to Plant Artichokes": "* Artichokes can be started from seeds, from rooted shoots taken from growing plants, or from dormant roots. * If starting from seeds: Start seeds indoors in late winter or early spring, about 8-10 weeks before planting outside. Soak the seeds in warm water before sowing in trays or pots. Place the trays or pots in a warm spot with bright light. Keep the soil moist. * Start seeds indoors in late winter or early spring, about 8-10 weeks before planting outside. * Soak the seeds in warm water before sowing in trays or pots. * Place the trays or pots in a warm spot with bright light. * Keep the soil moist. * Plant seedlings and shoots in the garden in the spring after the last spring frost . * Dormant roots can be planted in the fall or winter in frost-free regions . In cooler climates, plant the roots in the spring after the last frost.",
        "How to Plant Artichoke": "* Space each plant three to four feet apart in rows and leave four to five feet between the rows. * Plant the shoots and dormant roots about six inches deep. The tops should be above ground level. * Water deeply at the time of planting."
      }
    },
    "Growing": {
      "content": "Remove the straw and leaves after the last frost in the spring. For extra winter protection, add an additional foot of straw on top. In cooler regions, after the fall harvest, cut the plants back to about 6 inches and cover the crowns of the plant with leaves. When temperatures cool off in late summer and fall, the plants will start growing again and you may get a second harvest. Artichoke plants will go dormant in hot weather. Remove the mulch when the plants begin to bud and cover the soil around the plants with compost. Apply a balanced organic fertilizer once every month during the growing season. Mulcharound the plants to keep the moisture in the soil. Keep the soil moist. Artichokes need lots of water to form the edible buds.\n‘Green Globe’ matures early and is a good choice for northern gardeners. This variety can be grown as an annual. ‘Violetto’ produces purple slightly elongated buds. Best grown as a perennial. ‘Imperial Star’ has tasty round buds that mature early. It is an annual and will produce well-developed artichokes the first year from seed. Plants grow about 3 feet tall. Each produces 1-2 small primary buds and 5-7 smaller secondary buds. ‘Emerald’ has thornless buds and is very productive. It grows glossy, deep green buds on 4 to 5 feet tall plants. Grow it as a perennial in zones 7 and above.",
      "sub_headings": {
        "How to Propagate Artichokes": "* Select shoots from an established plant that produced well the previous year. * Remove shoots in the spring when they are about 8 inches high. * Cut the shoot off below the soil, at the point where it is attached to the mother plant at the root ball. * Carefully pull the roots that are attached to the shoot from the root ball. * Plant the shoot in a new spot or share with friends!"

    "Harvesting": {
      "content": "Use a sharp knife to cut across the stem about 1 to 2 inches below the bud. Harvest artichoke buds when they have swelled but are still closed tight.",
      "sub_headings": {
        "How to Store Artichokes": "* Sprinkle fresh artichokes with water and put them in a plastic bag. The artichokes can be stored in the refrigerator for up to two weeks. * To freeze artichoke hearts, first blanch the hearts in boiling water and a splash of lemon juice for 1-2 minutes. Cool and dry the hearts before putting them in plastic freezer bags."

    "Wit and Wisdom": "Historians believe that the first artichokes were grown in Sicily or North Africa. In 77 AD the Roman naturalist Pliny called the artichoke one of earth’s monstrosities. Wealthy Romans enjoyed artichokes prepared in honey and vinegar, seasoned with cumin. In the U.S., artichokes were first grown in Louisiana in the early 19th century. The vegetable was brought there by French and Spanish settlers.",

    "Cooking Notes": "Artichokes are delicious raw or cooked. They can also be pickled or canned. Before cooking, slice off the bottom of the stem and any tough outer leaves. Cut off about 1 inch of the spiky top of the artichoke. Steam artichokes, don’t boil them. Steaming cooks them with just the right amount of moisture.\nVegetables\nADVERTISEMENT\nAdvertisement\nADVERTISEMENT\nHi , I have a question about my artichoke plant that I grew from a seed last spring/summer . I didn’t do any research on them so it produced a few artichokes. All my other one died this one survived through this winter in 9b zone and is now producing small artichokes the problem is most of the stocks on the mother plant have broken not all the way off can I cut them off and reroot them since they will have no roots? Please help I don’t want to loose my plant Thank You Shelly D.\nWith artichokes, you can replant a shoot! Gently clear away some soil to reveal the plant’s roots. Using a sharp knife, cut off the shoots along with their roots. Ensure the shoots are at least eight inches in length. Finally, backfill the soil around the original plant and firm up with your hands. Then plant the shoot with the roots.\nI live in Illinois, zone 7a. Last year I did what you said, I cut back my artichoke plants in late October and then covered them with about 12 inches of leaf mulch. It seems that IL did have a fairly wet winter with alot of snow. When I uncovered the artichokes in the spring, they were just a mushy mess. Everyone of them had the roots rotted. I replanted last spring and am now ready to winterize once again but am afraid to use the same method. What did I do wrong? In fact the same thing happened to my raspberry bushes and strawberries. Could you please give me suggestions? Thank you.\nHi Jill, Sorry to hear about your artichokes. Since they are a Mediterranean crop, winter protection can be a bit tricky, although it is definitely possible to overwinter them. If your wet winter (snow and rain) was also accompanied by periods of thawing and freezing, it may not have mattered how well protected your artichoke crowns and roots were because that excessive moisture making its way into the ground followed by colder freezing temperatures is a recipe for disaster. You can certainly try to protect them inground again this year. Another way of doing it is to make a 2-foot-tall cage out of chicken wire (secured to the ground) that is 12 inches wider than the plant and fill it completely with leaves and straw. The cage will keep the leaves and straw in place. Some even recommend adding extra soil on top of the plants prior to mulching with leaves and straw. An alternative is to dig up the crowns and roots, remove as much soil as possible and store for the winter in a box of moist sand or peat in a cool location, like a garage or basement. Also, if you find yourself needing to plant new artichokes next year or in the future, consider planting varieties like Green Globe or Imperial Star, which have shorter growing seasons and are more hardy. Hope this helps!\nHow much do you cut them back in the summer? I live in zone 9b ( it's in the 100's now) and my plant is done producing and looking very ugly now.\nHi Stephanie, Artichoke is a perennial plant. Summer eat ends the harvest, toughens the edible parts and causes it to flower. Once the fruiting and harvest is done, cut back the plant (foliage and stems) to the soil level. You can either cover with mulch to initiate summer dormancy or allow the ornamental flower buds to form. Stop watering until early fall when the plant sends out new shoots in the fall. (You can stimulate a light crop in the fall by working compost into the soil around plants as growth resumes in cool weather.) If you wish, you can transplant new shoots into a new location in the garden or just leave them place to produce another year. Make sure you leave only the most vigorous shoot on the old plant for growth in the spring.\nThis year my artichokes are small and opening up completely too early.\nLast year my artichokes were green. This year they are purple... the plant is healthy and the globes look healthy. Are they still okay?\nHi Cathy, If the plant and globes look healthy they should still be fine. Depending on your growing conditions this winter, if temperatures dip to below freezing it can change the look of the artichokes to a brown or even purple color.\nWhy are ants all over my artichokes? They don’t seem to be eating them but there are a ton of ants on them!\nADVERTISEMENT"

Though popular on gourmet menus, arugula greens are quite easy to plant and grow in your home garden. About Arugula Arugula stems from the warmer parts of Europe—namely Italy and along the Mediterranean, through Turkey, and into western Asia. A member of the mustard family (Brassicaceae), it’s a relative of other common garden plants such as cabbage , broccoli , and kale . Arugula is often found in mesclun seed mixes, as it grows quickly and has a bolder flavor than most greens. Many people love the spicy, peppery taste in salads or as an accompaniment to sandwiches. Plant in early spring or early fall, and you can harvest young leaves 6 to 8 weeks after sowing. The seeds will germinate quickly in cool soil, and seedlings can tolerate a light frost, but consider protecting plants with cloches or row covers nonetheless!",

        "Where to Plant Arugula": "Arugula does best in nutrient-rich, well-draining soil but will tolerate a wide variety of conditions, making it a great choice for containers, raised beds, or traditional garden beds. It prefers slightly acidic soil with a pH between 6 and 7. Plant in a spot with full sun (6 or more hours of sunlight) for the best results. Arugula will grow in partial sun, but not as well. Avoid planting arugula in areas where its relatives (other Brassicas) have recently been planted, as pests and disease may persist.",
        "When to Plant Arugula": "* Arugula seeds will germinate in soil temperatures as low as 40°F (4°C), so sow them outdoors as soon as the soil can be worked in spring. See local frost dates . * Sow in late summer or early fall for a fall or winter harvest.",
        "How to Plant Arugula": "* Sow seeds ¼-inch deep and about 1 inch apart in rows 10 inches apart. Alternatively, broadcast arugula seeds alone or mix them with other salad greens . * Seeds germinate in about a week (or slightly longer in cold soil). Speed up germination by soaking seeds in water for a few hours prior to planting. * According to Susan Mahr from the University of Wisconsin–Madison, “Seedlings have two rounded cotyledons, each with an indentation on the end, while the first young leaves are entire and elongated. Older leaves have lobes of varying degrees, so these leaves look like dark green oak leaf lettuce—often deeply pinnate with 4-10 lobes.” * Sow new seeds every 2 to 3 weeks for a continuous harvest later on!"

I’m fairly certain I’ll be picking arugula by then. I planted ‘wild arugula’ (as depicted in the first photo to this article - thin, pointed leaves) five years ago and I have routinely let it go to seed, and as it is wildly prolific, I pull up plants from where I do not want them and move them. Consequently, I have arugula most everywhere in my back yard; it has become one of those 'pesky weeds' some speak of, except in my and my wife’s case, it is a Job Well Done. We love arugula, you see, and last year, e.g., I probably harvested 10-pounds of it if not more, gave away more than a few pounds, and even dug up some plants for an exterminator (something weirdly ironic there perhaps). We simply grow more arugula now than we 2 can eat, so the neighborhood gets some tasty free greens too. Win-win. I let it seed because the bees and other bugs love it. I have had pretty much no problems with it in terms of pests or disease, and it is one of very, oh so very few things those #$%^ deer will not eat. This naturalization is so ideal to me because now when I find arugula where I do not want it, I can just harvest it to the ground. Odds are it will come back, but if not, that’s fine because I have it in numerous places where I do want it, and as said, for the past five years, it has not diminished but rather multiplied, exponentially. Put it this way: this arugula is more pesky than any mint (or anything else) I have grown. And it is deliciously wonderful stuff (and makes a very fine tart, I should add). Grow it; let it seed; eat well. And fyi, I have grown carrots, potatoes and other crops with it; works fine. Will shade heavily after a few months growth so keep that in mind, but it also seems to deter pests, perhaps more so due to its hiding/burying the other crops. But again, just eat it down to the ground, thin heavily (once well established), and odds are it will simply return. An amazing plant.\nI planted a packet of mesclun in a flower bed. The rabbits ate all of the lettuce but did not touch the arugula. It grew big and beautiful. I cut the tops and put them around the lilies and iris and hosta to stop the rabbits from eating them. It seems to have worked. I think I will plant arugula on purpose next summer.\nI live in Billings, Montana and every year for the past 5 years, I have been unable to find Arugala seeds or plants. Any suggestions for finding them here? If not, then I have to order online again. I like that you included the names of some types of Arugala to get. Thanks!\nI believe these to be the best for mail ordering. Fedco https://fedcoseeds.com/\nHi, I would like to plant in pots. How big a pot should I use? Can I put other items in the same pot? Thanks\nLettuce greens, which include arugula, are fairly shallow rooted; they do not need but a couple or few inches of depth. More is fine but not necessary. See here for examples: https://www.almanac.com/how-grow-your-own-salad-greens So you can use any size container but if you are growing other things, you might want depth to satisfy their root needs. You can search for individual vegetables on this web site (go to the top of this page for the search box) and learn more about each one’s needs.\nResponding to Mary's question about harvesting seeds. I just finished this about 2 minutes ago! When one of my arugula beds was determined to bolt, I let it. I let the seeds dry in the pods on the plant. Tonight I went and cut them off and captured the tiny seeds on white paper and saved in an envelope. I left out the ones that were still a little green for fear they might mold the dry ones. Waiting for slightly cooler weather to replant.\nI would like to grow my Arugula again and have let some seed pods grow on a flowered plant. At present the seeds inside are green. What is the quickest way to dry them to brown so I can plant again this season? Or will I need to wait till next season?\nHi, Let’s say you pull your arugula out. What do you do with the soil afterwards? What is recommended to plant next?\nIt’s great to keep planting greens. They have quick harvests. This is called “succession planting.” You don’t want to plant ALL your seeds at the same time! You don’t need to do anything different. Plant every 10 to 14 days in between for an extended harvest. We would just fluff up (aerate) the soil a bit and replenish nutrients by forking in some compost and/or granular organic fertilizer.\nADVERTISEMENT"
