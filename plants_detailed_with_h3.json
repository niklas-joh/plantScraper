    "Subhead": "Planting, Growing, and Harvesting Artichokes\nApril 17, 2025\nThe globe artichoke is a perennial in the thistle family that produces long, silver-green, lobed leaves that make the artichoke look like a giant fern. Learn how to plant and grow edible artichokes in your garden! About Artichokes The buds (i.e., the “artichokes” that we harvest and eat), if allowed to flower, are thistle-like and violet. These large plants can be grown in rows in the garden, as informal hedges, or planted as a wide border. Artichokes can reach heights of 3 to 5 feet. Artichokes prefer cool, humid summers and mild winters. In cool regions, plan to treat the artichoke as an annual. One plant will produce many artichokes. The biggest bud grows on the top of the plant, and many smaller ones grow beneath. Even if you don’t like to eat artichokes, they’re still worth growing for their lovely, pollinator-friendly flowers!",
    "Planting": {
      "content": "Choose a spot in the garden that gets full sun (at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight per day). Artichokes are heavy feeders. Before planting each plant, mix a shovel of compost or aged manure into the soil. They require consistent moisture but do not like waterlogged soil.",
      "sub_headings": {
        "When to Plant Artichokes": "* Artichokes can be started from seeds, from rooted shoots taken from growing plants, or from dormant roots. * If starting from seeds: Start seeds indoors in late winter or early spring, about 8-10 weeks before planting outside. Soak the seeds in warm water before sowing in trays or pots. Place the trays or pots in a warm spot with bright light. Keep the soil moist. * Start seeds indoors in late winter or early spring, about 8-10 weeks before planting outside. * Soak the seeds in warm water before sowing in trays or pots. * Place the trays or pots in a warm spot with bright light. * Keep the soil moist. * Plant seedlings and shoots in the garden in the spring after the last spring frost . * Dormant roots can be planted in the fall or winter in frost-free regions . In cooler climates, plant the roots in the spring after the last frost.",
        "How to Plant Artichoke": "* Space each plant three to four feet apart in rows and leave four to five feet between the rows. * Plant the shoots and dormant roots about six inches deep. The tops should be above ground level. * Water deeply at the time of planting."
      }
    },
    "Growing": {
      "content": "Remove the straw and leaves after the last frost in the spring. For extra winter protection, add an additional foot of straw on top. In cooler regions, after the fall harvest, cut the plants back to about 6 inches and cover the crowns of the plant with leaves. When temperatures cool off in late summer and fall, the plants will start growing again and you may get a second harvest. Artichoke plants will go dormant in hot weather. Remove the mulch when the plants begin to bud and cover the soil around the plants with compost. Apply a balanced organic fertilizer once every month during the growing season. Mulcharound the plants to keep the moisture in the soil. Keep the soil moist. Artichokes need lots of water to form the edible buds.\n‘Green Globe’ matures early and is a good choice for northern gardeners. This variety can be grown as an annual. ‘Violetto’ produces purple slightly elongated buds. Best grown as a perennial. ‘Imperial Star’ has tasty round buds that mature early. It is an annual and will produce well-developed artichokes the first year from seed. Plants grow about 3 feet tall. Each produces 1-2 small primary buds and 5-7 smaller secondary buds. ‘Emerald’ has thornless buds and is very productive. It grows glossy, deep green buds on 4 to 5 feet tall plants. Grow it as a perennial in zones 7 and above.",
      "sub_headings": {
        "How to Propagate Artichokes": "* Select shoots from an established plant that produced well the previous year. * Remove shoots in the spring when they are about 8 inches high. * Cut the shoot off below the soil, at the point where it is attached to the mother plant at the root ball. * Carefully pull the roots that are attached to the shoot from the root ball. * Plant the shoot in a new spot or share with friends!"

    "Harvesting": {
      "content": "Use a sharp knife to cut across the stem about 1 to 2 inches below the bud. Harvest artichoke buds when they have swelled but are still closed tight.",
      "sub_headings": {
        "How to Store Artichokes": "* Sprinkle fresh artichokes with water and put them in a plastic bag. The artichokes can be stored in the refrigerator for up to two weeks. * To freeze artichoke hearts, first blanch the hearts in boiling water and a splash of lemon juice for 1-2 minutes. Cool and dry the hearts before putting them in plastic freezer bags."

    "Wit and Wisdom": "Historians believe that the first artichokes were grown in Sicily or North Africa. In 77 AD the Roman naturalist Pliny called the artichoke one of earth’s monstrosities. Wealthy Romans enjoyed artichokes prepared in honey and vinegar, seasoned with cumin. In the U.S., artichokes were first grown in Louisiana in the early 19th century. The vegetable was brought there by French and Spanish settlers.",

    "Cooking Notes": "Artichokes are delicious raw or cooked. They can also be pickled or canned. Before cooking, slice off the bottom of the stem and any tough outer leaves. Cut off about 1 inch of the spiky top of the artichoke. Steam artichokes, don’t boil them. Steaming cooks them with just the right amount of moisture."
